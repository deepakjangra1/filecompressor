# File Compressor
A C++ compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding.

This project is to design compression and decompression programs based on Huffman Coding.
The idea of Huffman Coding is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by means of assigning shorter codes to frequently-used characters and longer codes to seldom-used code.
